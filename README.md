# UGCA ( University Group Chat App )

this project is my CS final year project. its idea is to replace the regular chat apps that are not intended to be used for educational purposes.

the main goal of the project is to create groups where students and tutors can chat privatly without the need to use personal mobile number or random username.
the student should be able to login using his/her student ID provided by the educational institute (for example: university )

### How to make it run?

1. first you must have a webapp
